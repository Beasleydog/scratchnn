# Neural Network from Scratch

This project implements a neural network entirely from scratch using JavaScript, with the goal of understanding the mathematics behind neural networks, particularly backpropagation.

## Key Learning Points

1. **Feedforward Propagation**: Implemented the forward pass, understanding data flow through layers.
2. **Backpropagation**: Developed a thorough understanding of the algorithm, including error calculation and gradient computation.
3. **Gradient Descent**: Implemented stochastic gradient descent for parameter optimization.
4. **Activation Functions**: Explored different functions and their impact on learning.
5. **Matrix Operations**: Utilized extensively, reinforcing linear algebra understanding. Used some concepts from my MATH 214 class!

## Implementation Details

- `Network` class initializes the neural network
- Methods for feedforward propagation and backpropagation
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for training
- Helper functions for mathematical operations
